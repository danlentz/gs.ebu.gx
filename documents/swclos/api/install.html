<H1>Downloading and Installing Lisp Code for Automated Planning</H1>
<P>
This page gives instructions for retrieving the code for the book, and
installing it on your local system.  This installation procedure need
only be followed once.  

<H2>Downloading the Code</H1>
<P>
To download the code, follow these steps:

<OL>
<LI> Create a directory where you want the code to reside, and change to that directory.
On Unix, this might be "<tt>mkdir &lt;<I>planning</I>&gt;; cd &lt;<I>planning</I>&gt</tt>".

<LI> </b>Download the source code</b>. The easiest way is to click on
this link to get <a href="../code.tar">code.tar</a> (???KB).    

<LI> Execute the command, on Unix, <tt>tar xf code.tar</tt>, or on Windows, 
drag the code.tar file to a program such as WinZip.
to unpack the archive of files.  
</OL>

<H2>Installing a Lisp Interpreter/Compiler</H2>
<P>
There are many available Lisp compilers that you can use.  However, we 
have tested the code only the following:
<ul>
<li> <a href="http://www.franz.com/downloads/">Franz
Allegro Common Lisp</a> for Windows.
</ul>
<P>We hope that someone ports the program to any other Lisp system. 
<P>
If you have no Allegro CL system, you can install the evaluation version from 
<a href="http://www.franz.com/downloads/">Franz Inc</a>. 
It is free but some months later you will be required to respond the query when starting lisp system 
whether you upgrade or not. However, you can continue to use it 
with replying "CONTINUE". 
<H3>How to change character mode:</H3>
We always use ACL in modern mode (character case sensitive), in which
lisp system distinguishes upper-case letters and lower-case letters. 
We recommend to follow the instruction below in order to set up modern mode for 
the evaluation version.  If you purchase ACL, the setting is just menu selection 
in Windows version. 

<OL>
<LI>Run original aclxx-express.
<LI>Execute the following form in Lisp window. You will obtain 'allegro.exe' file under 
'C:\Program Files\acl80-express' folder.
<pre class="box"><code>     (progn
       (build-lisp-image "sys:allegro.dxl" :case-mode :case-sensitive-lower)
       (when (probe-file "sys:allegro.exe") (delete-file "sys:allegro.exe"))
       (sys:copy-file "sys:allegro-ansi.exe" "sys:allegro.exe"))
</code></pre><BR>
<LI>To start Lisp, invoke 'allegro.exe' instead of 'allegro-ansi.exe'. 
In Windows, it is good idea to set up the start menu for 'allegro.exe'. You may copy the start menu folder for 
'allegro-ansi.exe' and revise the link of short-cut file.
</OL>

<H2>Installing the Code</H1>

<OL>
<LI> Make sure you have both read-permission and write-permission for
the directory where the code is kept.

<P><LI> Edit the file "planning.cl" and change the value of the
parameter *planning-root* to reflect the location of the files.
Make sure to use the proper syntax for a directory, not a regular
file.  For example, on a Unix file system, you want something like
"/usr/local/planning/", or "/home/yourname/planning/", where the final "/"
indicates that /usr/local/planning is a directory.  For a Windows file
system, you'd have something like "C:\\allegro-projects\\planning\\".  Note that you have to
use double backslashes, because backslashes are treated specially in
Common Lisp strings.

<P><LI> For some unusual Lisp compilers instead of ACL, you may need to edit the parameter
*planning-binary-type* to indicate the type of files created by your Lisp
compiler.  If the compiler creates files of the form "name.bin", then set
this parameter to "bin".  Do include the double-quote marks.
</OL>

<h2>Running the Code</h2>

The steps above need be done only once;
you  are now ready for the easier process of
<A HREF="user.html">using the code</A>.
