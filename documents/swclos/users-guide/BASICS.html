<h2>2. &nbsp;SWCLOS Basics</h2>

<h3>2.1 &nbsp;How to Get SWCLOS</h3>

<p>SWCLOS is an Open Source Program that was originally developed at GALAXY EXPRESS
CORPORATION in Japan, and Seiji Koide, who is the developer of SWCLOS, has been continued
updating it. The latest version is available from Koide's home page at National Institute of Informatics (NII) 
<a href="http://www-kasm.nii.ac.jp/~koide/SWCLOS2-en.htm">
http://www-kasm.nii.ac.jp/~koide/SWCLOS2-en.htm</a>.
</p>

<p>The SWCLOS current version is developed on Allegro Common Lisp 8.1 Windows version that is
delivered by Franz Inc. We hope someone ports it to other lisp systems, although it is probably hard,
because partly the implementation is concerned with ACL features.
</p>

<h3>2.2 &nbsp;Proprietary Rights</h3>

<p>GALAXY EXPRESS CORPORATION holds all copyrights and allows anyone to use anyhow AS IS,
except modifying the package name of <b>gx</b> and <b>gx-user</b>, and the object name <b>galaxy</b>. 
'GX' is the rocket name from GALAXY EXPRESS CORPORATION. See README file in delivery.
</p>

<h3>2.3 &nbsp;How to Start SWCLOS</h3>

<p>After compiling and loading SWCLOS into the ACL modern lisp version, it is much better to enter <b>gx-user</b>
package in the lisp listener window to use SWCLOS. Please note that SWCLOS requires
case-sensitive-lower on case mode of lisp reader to distinguish upper and lower case of letters. This
features is not ANSI-standard today, but we hope it will be so, soon.
</p>

<blockquote>
<pre><code><b>cg-user(1): (in-package gx-user)
#&lt;The gx-user package&gt;
gx-user(2): 
</b></code></pre></blockquote>

<p>Franz has prepared with a good tutorial for the case of letters.

<h3>2.4 &nbsp;Monotonicity of Knowledge</h3>

<p>In Semantic Webs you assume that the knowledge always increases and the interpretation become
monotonously more precise and richer. SWCLOS leverages the monotonicity principle in Semantic Webs
to accept the forward reference. In the current version, there are no delete functions for entities in
ontologies, and there is no undo functionality. Such functions will be provided at the next version.</p>

<p>Please note that (setf (slot-value ...) ...) do not overwrite the previous slot value. The
slotvalue setting function just adds a new value into the slot. This is a reflection of the monotonicity
principle. Do not fear it. You can make slot unbound, so you can reset any values after unbinding, if you
would like so.</p>

<h3>2.5 &nbsp;Open World Assumption and Three-Value Logic</h3>

<p>Semantic Webs assume that the World Wide Webs are dynamic, changeable, and open in the sense that no
one knows all of WWWs. From the viewpoint of Logic, Close World Assumption is a base of inference.
Therefore, people who are accustomed to logic thinking should mind this point.
</p>

<p>The primary function of Description Logics (DLs) is i) to classify objects to classes, ii) to determine
whether or not a class is subsumed by another class. In SWCLOS, this work is performed by i) <b>gx:typep</b>
and ii) <b>gx:subtypep</b> in the RDF universe and <b>subsumed-p</b> in the OWL universe. These functions return
two values; the first value is yes/no for query and the second represents the certainty. Therefore, the pair of
return values &lt;t,t&gt; expresses boolean true, &lt;nil,t&gt; expresses boolean false, and &lt;nil,nil&gt; means unknown.
Note that this ternary-value logic is an extension of ANSI Common Lisp native specification on cl:subtypep,
which returns two values described above. See the document of ANSI Common Lisp <a href="http://www.franz.com/support/documentation/8.1/ansicl/dictentr/subtypep.htm">
http://www.franz.com/support/documentation/8.1/ansicl/dictentr/subtypep.htm</a>. However, you do
not need to mind how to use ternary value logic. If you use only the first return value, your program does
not care of unknown and it is regarded as boolean false. If you are interested how to compute ternary-value
logic in SWCLOS, see the source code you obtained.
