<h2>13. &nbsp;OWL Axioms and Entailment Rules </h2>

<h3>13.1 &nbsp;Intersection of Concepts </h3>

<p>The intersection of concepts is represented by owl:intersectionOf property in OWL. In Wine Ontology, 
the WhiteBurgundy definition has separated to the two parts, the intersection definition part and the subclass definition 
part, while they are aggregated in SWCLOS. Here, the WhiteBurgundy is an intersection of the Burgundy and 
the WhiteWine. So, a question here is whether the WhiteBurgundy is a subclass of the Burgundy and the 
WhiteWine. The answer is, of course, yes. But, it is by one of OWL entailments upon intersection. Namely,
every member of the intersection of the extension of the Burgundy (a set of instances of the Burgundy) 
and the extension of the WhiteWine (a set of instances of the WhiteWine) is also a member of the 
extension of the Burgundy and the WhiteWine.</p>

<p>The role of cocept intersection is not only this entailment. The intersection definition is 
<i>complete</i>, that is, if the intersection of concepts at the right-hand side of equality is 
established, then the left-hand side is established. In the above example, if some wine is an 
instance of the Burgundy and the WhiteWine, then it is also an instance of WhiteBurgundy, definitely. 
If some wine class is subsumed by both the Burgundy class and the WhiteWine class, then it is subsumed 
by the BurgundyWhiteWine.
You do not need to mind the openness in the case of such complete definition.</p>

<h3>13.2 &nbsp;Union of Concepts</h3>

In Food Ontology, the fruit is defined as union of the sweetfruit and the non-sweetfruit. See the following 
demonstration. Of course, the fruit is a superclass of the sweetfruit and the non-sweetfruit, because 
any member of the extension of sweetfruit (a set of instances of food:SweetFruit) or any member of the 
extension of non-sweetfruit (as set of instances of food:NonSweetFruit) is also a member of union of both, 
namely a member of the extension of union of both.</p>

<b>
<pre><code>gx-user(4): (get-form food:Fruit)
(owl:Class food:Fruit (owl:unionOf food:SweetFruit food:NonSweetFruit))
gx-user(5): (get-form food:NonSweetFruit)
(owl:Class food:NonSweetFruit 
           (rdfs:subClassOf food:EdibleThing)
           (owl:disjointWith food:SweetFruit))
</code></pre>
</b><br /> <br />

<p>So, the question here is the subsumption between 

<blockquote>
<pre><code>gx-user(6): (get-form (-> eg:courses/6.001 vocab:students rdf:rest rdf:rest rdf:first))
(rdfs:Resource (rdf:about "http://example.org/students/Johann"))
gx-user(7): (-> eg:courses/6.001 vocab:students rdf:rest rdf:rest rdf:rest)
#&lt;rdf:List rdf:nil&gt;
</code></pre>
</blockquote>

<p>However, using rdf:List is very tedious in SWCLOS. We can use the lisp list to 
represent a collection in SWCLOS. You may represent the collection of students as 
follows, whereas the RDF graph is not equal to Figure 10.2. </p>

<p>Even though this input form does not contain rdf:first and rdf:rest, it is very 
easy for lisp programmers to imagine the above forms from the list structure in 
Figure 10.2. </p>
