<p>SWCLOS is a software toolkit for lisp programmers who want to process knowledge in Lisp. The name is
an acronym of Semantic Web Common Lisp Object System. As the name implies, SWCLOS is built on top
of Common Lisp Object System (CLOS) for Semantic Webs. In SWCLOS, every entity in vocabulary of
RDF, RDFS, and OWL, including user-defined one, denotes a CLOS object, and the computational
semantics are based on RDF(S) and OWL rather than CLOS, whereas it still conforms to object-oriented
paradigm.
</p>

<p>SWCLOS is an amalgam of Semantic Web Technology and the Object-Oriented Programming language.
Compared with the other reasoners for Semantic Webs, SWCLOS seems to have unique features. We may
say pros and cons of SWCLOS are ascribed to CLOS and the nature of Lisp. If you believe you are a lisp
programmer and you need to develop an application for Semantic Technology, SWCLOS is the solution.
Furthermore, if you have ever programmed CLOS programs, SWCLOS is the best choice. SWCLOS
provides OWL Full level ontology meta-modeling facilities using CLOS meta-programming capability.
You can encode CLOS programs for Semantic Webs on top of SWCLOS as you usually do in Lisp,
whereas you must understand the difference of semantics between the standard CLOS and RDF(S)/OWL.
</p>

<p>YThis document is userÅfs manual for SWCLOS programmers. Your program in SWCLOS can read ontology
files in RDF/XML format, N-Triple format, and lisp S-expression which is specified for SWCLOS. Then,
you can handle SWCLOS objects in Lisp, and write computational results in the various formats mentioned
above. Therefore, you can communicate with others in such formats for Semantic Webs. If you are a CLOS
programmer and want to understand what Semantic Technology is, SWCLOS provides you with a good
chance to learn and get started Semantic Technology.
