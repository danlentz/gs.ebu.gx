<h2>12. &nbsp;OWL in SWCLOS </h2>

<p>The OWL Web Ontology Languages, which are the extension of RDF and RDFS, are the W3C
Recommendation for Web Ontology description. There are three sub-languages of OWL, that is, OWL
Light, OWL DL, and OWL Full. The OWL Light specification is prepared for an easy realization by
implementers. However, the capability of ontology description is lower than other OWL languages. The
capability of ontology description of OWL DL is underpinned by Description Logic (DL). The satisfiability
checking and the entailment rules by DL is very powerful and useful to describe a consistent ontology, but
the inference on datatype is out of scope of DL, and ones cannot treat classes as an instance of some class
in the same way of RDFS. OWL Full provides full power for ontology description, where the class is not
discriminated to the instance, and ones can treat classes as instance in the same way as RDFS. However, it
is difficult to implement the OWL Full metamodeling capability in the framework of Logics.
</p>

<p>SWCLOS is a language for Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) that is built on top of CLOS. CLOS
allows ones metamodeling, namely, programmers can treat classes as instance of some class. Thus, if you
are familiar with meta-programming of CLOS, you can encode metamodeling of ontology in SWCLOS.
With SWCLOS you will get the performance of OWL Full.
</p>

<h3>12.1 &nbsp;OWL Extension of RDF and RDFS</h3>

<p>In theory, OWL is an extension of RDF and RDFS. Therefore, any OWL file, including the OWL
specification file that is described in RDF/XML, must be readable as RDF rather than OWL. In practice,
we can obtain, with the OWL specification file <a href="http://www.w3.org/2002/07/owl.rdf">owl.rdf</a> from W3C, 
OWL entities as RDF resource
objects in the RDF universe. See the following demonstration, in which only RDFS module of SWCLOS
has been loaded initially.

<p>In this demonstration, after boot up SWCLOS without OWL modules, invoking <b>read-rdf-file</b> caused to
load owl.rdf file. Some results by reading owl.rdf were demonstrated with <b>get-form</b> on owl:Thing and
owl:Nothing.
</p>

<p>However, this ontology does not result any capability upon OWL entailments and includes some
ambiguities of inclusiveness between the RDF universe and the OWL universe. An OWL reasoner must be
equipped with OWL semantics so as to realize many OWL entailments as well as clear-cut relation between
the RDF universe and the OWL universe. OWL module of SWCLOS provides OWL functionalities with
the owl.rdf file. After this section, OWL realization on SWCLOS is explained.
</p>

<h3>12.2 &nbsp;Description Logic and OWL in SWCLOS</h3>

<p>The syntax and semantics of Description Logic (DL) is compactly described at Appendix of 
<i>The Description Logic Handbook</i> from Cambridge Press. In this section, OWL DL semantics 
is explained partly using DL terminologies and partly using OWL terminologies. 
Note that the following remarks.</p>

<p>To define a concept in OWL, <b>defConcept</b> is used as <b>defResource</b> in RDFS. Both macros generate
completely same forms, but the purpose of '<b>defConcept</b>' macro is just syntax sugar for OWL. See the
following example after loading OWL module, where the concept Woman and Man are defined. In addition,
an anonymous class that stands for the concept of negation of Woman, is defined. Since the negation of
Woman represents a set of all individuals of Man, the concept Man is defined as the intersection of Person
and the negation of Woman. The following demonstration also shows the entailment of intersection of
concepts.
</p>

<b><pre><code>
gx-user(7): (defConcept Woman (owl:intersectionOf Person Female))

Warning: Range entailX3 by owl:intersectionOf: Female rdf:type owl:Class.
#&lt;owl:Class Woman&gt;
gx-user(8): (defConcept Man (owl:intersectionOf 
                               Person
                               (owl:Class (owl:complementOf Woman))))

</code></pre></b>
<br />

<p>The concept that is not defined but referred is called <i>atomic concept</i>, e.g., Person and Female in the above
demonstration, while a <i>complex concept</i> is defined using other concepts (complex or atomic), e.g., Woman
and Man. The atomic concept in SWCLOS exists as object but does not have slot values except
rdfs:subClassOf and owl:equivalentClass.
</p>

<h3>12.3 &nbsp;OWL Property Restrictions</h3>

<p>A complex concept is often composed of concepts and restrictions. A restriction, which is an instance of
owl:Restriction, works as constraint for a specific property and a specific concept. A property restriction is
anonymous and has only two slots of owl:onPropertyOf and restriction types, i.e., owl:allValuesFrom,
owl:someValuesFrom, owl:hasValue, owl:maxCardinality, owl:minCardinality, and owl:cardinality.
</p>

<p>In the following example, the concept Mother is defined as the intersection of Woman and the restriction such that
the property hasChild must exist in Woman individuals and one value of the property hasChild must be an
instance of Person at least.
</p>

<b>
<pre><code>
gx-user(13): (defConcept Mother
                         (owl:intersectionOf
                            Woman
                            (owl:Restriction (owl:onProperty hasChild)
                                             (owl:someValuesFrom Person))))
Warning: Range entailX3 by owl:onProperty: hasChild rdf:type rdf:Property.
#&lt;owl:Class Mother&gt;
gx-user(14): (defConcept Father 
                         (owl:intersectionOf 
                            Man
                            (owl:Restriction (owl:onProperty hasChild)
                                             (owl:someValuesFrom Person))))
#&lt;owl:Class Father&gt;
</code></pre></b>
<br />

<p>The property restriction in the intersection is useful to make a sub concept that is specialized by the
property restriction. In the above case, the concept Mother is defined as Woman who has the slot hasChild,
in which one slot value at least must be an instance of a Person. Exactly speaking on the above
demonstration, it is possible to have something but Person in the hasChild slot in the above definition. Note
that it is needed to add the value restriction (owl:allValuesFrom) on hasChild for Person, if you want to
restrict that all of children must be a Person, exactly in OWL semantics.
</p>

<p>Note that owl:Restriction in OWL is specialized to subclass restrictions in SWCLOS, i.e.,
owl:hasValueRestriction, owl:someValuesFromRestriction, owl:allValuesFromRestriction, or
owl:cardinalityRestriction. The reason is mainly for human readability of an anonymous object of
owl:Restriction. SWCLOS provides the customization of printing restrictions. See the followings.
</p>

<blockquote>
<b>
<pre><code>
gx-user(15): (-> Father owl:intersectionOf)
(#&lt;owl:Class Man&gt; #&lt;ÅŒhasChild.Person&gt;)
</code></pre></b>
</blockquote>
<br />

<p>In CLOS, we have the type option in the slot definition. Therefore, we have implemented the
allValuesFrom functionality and the someValuesFrom functionality through this type option in the slot
definition as well as the range value constraint in RDFS. Furthermore, in order to implement the cardinality
constraint, we set two new slot option, <b>maxcardinality</b> and <b>mincardinality</b>in the slot definition as
<b>OwlProperty-slot-definition</b>.
</p>

<h3>12.4 &nbsp;Substantial and non-Substantial Relationship</h3>

<p>Whereas the subsumption relationship is decided with only rdfs:subClassOf in RDFS, the subsumption
decidability is very complicated in OWL. There are many properties that rule subsumption, such as
rdfs:subClassOf, owl:intersectionOf, owl:unionOf, owl:equivalentClass, owl:equivalentProperty,
rdfs:subPropertyOf, etc. From the viewpoint of DL, they have same strength for subsumption decidability.
However, from the viewpoint of Ontology Engineering, generally we have to discriminate substantial ones
and non-substantial ones for subsumption. For instance, the wife and husband relation is weaker than
man/person or woman/person relation. The former is not substantial but the latter is substantial.
</p>

<p>On the other hand, from the viewpoint of CLOS, rdfs:subClassOf relation is mapped onto class-subclass
relation, and a CLOS object as rdfs:subClassOf property value is also placed in the direct-superclasses list
slot in the class metaobject. Then, in case that a property <i>prop1</i> is a subproperty of rdfs:subClassOf, or a
equivalent property of rdfs:subClassOf, whether or not should we place the property value into the
direct-superclasses list in the class to which the property <i>prop1</i> is attached? In other words, what property
should cause the structural variation in CLOS superclass-subclass relation, and what property should not
cause the structural variation? For instance, food:Wine is equivalent to vin:Wine, and food:Wine in Food
Ontology does not have any slots, and vin:Wine in Wine Ontology has many slots. If we add vin:Wine into
the direct-superclasses list of food:Wine, then food:Wine inherits all slot definitions in the superclasses of
vin:Wine. So, should we put the same slots as vin:Wine to food:Wine or not? In SWCLOS, we specified
that rdfs:subClassOf, owl:intersectionOf, and owl:unionOf should cause the structural variation of CLOS,
but other properties such as owl:equivalentClass, owl:equivalentProperty, including subproperties and
equivalent properties of rdfs:subClass, owl:intersectionOf, and owl:unionOf, should not cause the structural
variation. The predicate <b>gx:subtypep</b> supports the subsumption by class-subclass relation in RDFS
semantics, and <b>subsumed-p</b> reasons the subsumption using other subsumption-related properties in OWL.
</p>

<p>From the standpoint of ontology engineering, the effects of substantial properties may propagate to other
entities, but the result of non-substantial properties should not cause any side effects in ontology. Thus,
such discrimination rule of substantial and non-substantial subsumption allows ones to add and delete the
relation of rdfs:subPropertyOf, owl:equivalentClass, etc., and keeps easy to maintain ontologies.
</p>

<h3>12.5 &nbsp;Axiomatic Complete Relations</h3>

<p>Among many properties in OWL, only four properties, i.e., owl:intersectionOf, owl:unionOf,
owl:complementOf, and owl:oneOf make axiomatic complete relations. In other words, these properties
define complete equivalency upon the binary relation of concepts. For example, the following states the
definition of WhiteBordeaux, and if something is a Bordeaux and WhiteWine, it should be concluded to be
a WhiteBordeaux.
</p>

<b><pre><code>gx-user(2): (defpackage vin)
#&lt;The vin package&gt;
gx-user(3): (defConcept vin::WhiteBordeaux (rdf:type owl:Class)
 (owl:intersectionOf vin::Bordeaux vin::WhiteWine))
Warning: Range entailX3 by owl:intersectionOf: vin::Bordeaux rdf:type owl:Class.
Warning: Range entailX3 by owl:intersectionOf: vin::WhiteWine rdf:type owl:Class.
#&lt;owl:Class vin:WhiteBordeaux&gt;
gx-user(4): (defIndividual aWine (rdf:type vin:Bordeaux vin:WhiteWine))
Warning: Multiple classing with (#&lt;owl:Class vin:Bordeaux&gt; #<owl:Class vin:WhiteWine>) for #&lt;vin:Bordeaux aWine&gt;
#&lt;vin:WhiteBordeaux aWine&gt;
</code></pre></b>
<br />

<p>Similarly, the following assertion defines WineColor, which has the enumerative membership of White,
Rose, and Red of complete relation, so that it states that the instance of WineColor is exactly one of the
three, and not to be the others.
</p>

<b><pre><code>gx-user(5): (defConcept vin::WineColor (rdf:type owl:Class)
 (owl:oneOf vin::White vin::Rose vin::Red))
#&lt;owl:Class vin:WineColor&gt;
gx-user(6): vin:White
#&lt;vin:WineColor vin:White&gt;
</code></pre></b>
<br />

<p>Therefore, it is not necessary to mind Open World Assumption upon such axiomatic complete relation
properties. If we find the contents of the definition body matches the database, then we may conclude the
definition is applicable to the database without a worry about other statements.
</p>

<p>See the following example. SWCLOS concludes that QueenElizabethII should be a woman, because there
is a terminology that a person who has gender female is a woman, and it is asserted that QueenElizabethII
is an instance of Person and hasGender Female. Here, note that SWCLOS proactively made the entailment
without demand or query from users.
</p>

<b><pre><code>
